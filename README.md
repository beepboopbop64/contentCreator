🚀 contentCreator: Automated Blog Post Generation with GPT-4 Integration
Welcome to contentCreator! This project leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate blog posts on various topics, starting with ANOVA. Whether you're diving deep into data science concepts or exploring new ideas, contentCreator is here to help you craft engaging, informative content in just a few clicks. 🧠✨

🌟 Features
TDD-Driven Development: We built this project using Test-Driven Development (TDD), ensuring robust and reliable code from the start.
GPT-4 Integration: Seamlessly generate content using OpenAI's GPT-4 API, with the ability to customize prompts for various tones and styles.
Environment-First: API keys are securely managed with a .env file, following best practices for handling sensitive information.
Modular Design: The codebase is organized into modules, making it easy to expand functionality or tweak existing features.
📚 How It Works
1. Generate an Outline 📝
The first step in creating a blog post is generating an outline. This gives structure to your content by breaking it down into key sections like "Introduction," "Body," and "Conclusion."

python
Copy code
from generators.blog_post_generator import generate_outline

outline = generate_outline("ANOVA")
2. Generate Content 🧠
Next, we use GPT-4 to fill in the sections of the outline with detailed content. This is where the magic happens—GPT-4 crafts content based on the prompts we provide.

python
Copy code
from generators.blog_post_generator import generate_content

content = generate_content(outline, "ANOVA")
3. Format the Blog Post 🎨
Finally, we format the generated content into a cohesive blog post, ready to be published or further edited.

python
Copy code
from generators.blog_post_generator import format_blog_post

formatted_post = format_blog_post(content)
print(formatted_post)
🎉 Voila! You’ve got yourself a blog post! 🎉

🔧 Setup & Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/beepboopbop64/contentCreator.git
cd contentCreator
2. Install Dependencies
You’ll need Python and pip installed. Then, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Your .env File
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
4. Run the Example
Generate your first blog post on "ANOVA" by running:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
🚀 Future Enhancements
Video Script Generation: Extend the content generation to video scripts, helping you create scripts with ease.
Advanced Customization: Provide more control over the tone, style, and depth of the generated content.
Interactive UI: Build a user-friendly interface to make content generation even more accessible.
